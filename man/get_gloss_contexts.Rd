\title{Searching the occurrence contexts of a gloss in a dataset}
\usage{
get_gloss_contexts(gloss, file, mode = "full")
}
\arguments{
\item{gloss}{A character string representing the gloss to search for (case-sensitive).}

\item{file}{A character string giving the path to the WRIML-annotated data file.}

\item{mode}{\code{full} (returns the whole data block) | \code{contexts} (only returns the context and the ID of the data (block))}
}
\value{
The list of data (if \code{mode = "full"} is ) or the list of contexts (if \code{mode = "contexts"} is chosen) in "file" in which the gloss appears. Optionally exports the results to .tex, .wriml, .txt or .rmd. Note that: ".tex"-export is not available in the \code{contexts} mode.
}
\description{
\code{get_gloss_contexts} is a \code{meanalyzeR} UI function that returns the set of data or contexts in which a given gloss
appears within a dataset that is marked up using the WRIML language.

\section{About WRIML}{

WRIML (WRIting Markup Language) is a lightweight markup language designed to
annotate documents -- such as linguistic data -- in plain text. It uses a
system of inline tags prefixed by \verb{ ^} to open and \verb{ _} to close each tag.
Tags can include optional attributes using a key="value" syntax.

Only the WRIML format is currently supported by this function. Full documentation
on WRIML is available at: \url{https://github.com/dbjoshua/WRIML-presentation}
}

\section{Data markup template}{

A minimal WRIML-annotated data block should follow this structure:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{^data
^id ex01 _id
^ct_type="out-of-the-blue" This sentence was said spontaneously. _ct
^aj _aj
^tx John eats an apple. _tx
^mb John eat-s an apple _mb
^gl JOHN EAT-3SG ART APPLE _gl
^tr John eats an apple. _tr
^lt John eats one apple _lt
_data
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The tags used here are \strong{reserved} and must not be redefined or reused for other
purposes. These include:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: Encloses a full data block.
\item \code{ct}: Provides contextual information about the utterance. Use the \code{type} attribute
to specify the nature of the context (e.g., \code{out-of-the-blue}, \code{bridging}, \code{donkey}).
\item \code{aj}: Consultant's acceptability judgment (empty = fully acceptable).
\item \code{tx}: The unsegmented utterance (optional).
\item \code{mb}: The segmented morpheme line (mandatory).
\item \code{gl}: The gloss line corresponding to \code{mb} (mandatory).
\item \code{tr}: The free translation (optional).
\item \code{lt}: The literal translation (optional).
\item \code{id} or \code{rf}: Unique identifier of the data block (mandatory).
}

The attribute name \code{type} is also reserved for describing the nature of the context
in the \code{ct} tag. Users must \strong{avoid defining their own tags} using:
\itemize{
\item Any of the reserved tag names above
\item Tags beginning with any of these names (e.g., \code{glossnote} is invalid)
\item Any tag using the reserved attribute \code{type} outside of \code{ct}
}

Outside of these restrictions, users are free to define their own tags for additional metadata.

A full template and example projects are available at:
\url{https://github.com/dbjoshua/meanalyzeR}
}

\section{About export formats}{

\itemize{
\item The \code{"contexts"} mode is intended purely for analysis; \code{.tex} is \strong{not} available
as an export format for this mode.
\item Export to \code{.tex} is designed for researchers who wish to directly incorporate data
into their manuscripts.
\item The exported LaTeX syntax is based on the \code{interlinear} package, but users may
define a compatible \code{interlinear} environment in their LaTeX preamble.
\item If the \code{type} attribute is missing in a context, it will be displayed as \verb{[unspecified]}
}
}

\section{Toolbox Support}{

Support for the Linguist's Toolbox (by SIL) may be added in future versions for:
\itemize{
\item Importing annotated data
\item Exporting results using Toolbox-compatible macros
}

If there is enough interest from researchers, Toolbox support will be prioritized.
